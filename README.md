# RESTOCPButtons
Push physical buttons by REST request

Using a Raspberry Pi (with camera) you can toggle it's GPIOs by REST requests.
When you connect these infamous [relay boards](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=8+channel+relay+board) to the GIPOs
you can switch almost any thing like lights or buttons on a Operator Control Panel.

Very useful if you want to power on a device

It tries to include a [webcam](https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface) but this part is far away from being nice.
